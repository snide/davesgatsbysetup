### A dynamic theming starter for Gatsby

This is a simple Gatsby starter to get you up and running with TypeScript and a dynamic theming layer provided by Emotion JS. It has the following features:

1. Set up for TypeScript
2. Dynamic theming using [Emotion JS][2] and [Polished][5]
3. Proper ESLint and Prettier rules
4. [Husky][4] for precommit hooks and checks
5. [MDX][3] for page composition. Currently uses v1 until the gatsby plugin updates.
6. GraphQL source content. Which means you can immediately tie in [GraphCMS][1].

Requires google api key and google font web fonts developer API enabled in GCP
